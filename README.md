# 🚀 ProjectStarter

Stop wasting time copying settings from old repositories. Start coding immediately.

## ✨ Features

ProjectStarter can instantly generate:

- 📁 `.gitignore`
- 🎯 `.editorconfig`
- 🔐 `.env.example`
- 🧠 VSCode settings
- 🧩 Recommended VSCode extensions
- 📦 Node.js starter project
- ▶ Ready-to-run `index.js`

## 🎯 The Problem

Every time you start a new project, you probably:

- Copy `.gitignore` from somewhere
- Recreate VSCode settings
- Set up `.env` structure
- Write the same boilerplate again

It’s repetitive.  
It’s boring.  
It wastes time.

**ProjectStarter automates all of it.**
